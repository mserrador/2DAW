00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In this video, we're going to see how to work with the video tag, and you'll see that it's very similar to the audio tag.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Here I've already downloaded a copyright-free video, and here in SRC we'll put the path.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It will be embedded content, assets, video, crotch de band.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We save, and if we look at this, we have the same issue we had initially with audio.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We can't play, change the volume, or anything like that.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
For this, we need the controls attribute, just like with audio.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And this way, you see that a video player appears, more familiar to what we're used to.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I'm going to do something here, which isn't part of the course, but it's just the same as with images

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
to prevent it from overflowing.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So we'll say max-width 100%, and this way we have the video without any scrolling.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I'll also remove this to have a bit more space.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And the controls we have, or rather the attributes, are practically the same.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We can set autoplay, and the video would start like this.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We also have the muted attribute, although this particular video has no audio.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
But we could add it, and the video would appear muted if it had audio.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I'll leave it here so you know that this attribute is available.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000
In fact, if you see here with that attribute, the speaker icon is crossed out.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
We also have the loop attribute, which I didn't mention with audio but is also available for audio.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
It allows the video to start over from the beginning once it finishes.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000
This is also something that Instagram has so that the video, once it finishes, starts again from the beginning.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And lastly, an attribute that audio doesn't have for reasons you'll see now—I'll remove autoplay.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
It's the poster attribute. This allows you to set what our initial image will be.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
It would be like the thumbnail if we were talking about YouTube.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Here we can put embedded content, assets, image, and for example, cover.jpg.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:45.000
We save. As you see, this appears as the poster, and once we press play, the video starts from the first frame.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So with poster, you can control what will be displayed before the video plays.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
If we set autoplay, which is why I removed it, you don't really get to see the image well.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
As you see here, it appears for half a second and then the video starts playing.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So that's what I wanted to share with you about the video tag.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And in the next one, we'll talk about iframes, which you may never need to write yourself,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
but it will be useful to learn how to insert content into your website from external sites.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Be it YouTube, Instagram, Spotify, or hundreds of sites that allow us to take an iframe and embed it in our website.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
But I'll tell you more about that in the next video.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000
I hope you're enjoying this new HTML5 course, and if you have any questions or queries,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
there’s a link in the description to the Discord community where there are over 600 people,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and we're all willing to lend a hand if needed.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Also, every Friday I'm on Twitch at 10 p.m. Spanish time,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and I also answer questions and do practical exercises that I think can help the community take their first steps in web development.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000
So if you like this content and want to stay up to date, I encourage you to subscribe to the channel, it's completely free.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
See you in the next one.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Greetings and goodbye.
